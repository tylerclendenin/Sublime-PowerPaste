Sublime-PowerPaste
==================

A plugin for SublimeText 2 trying to bring the power of [Sam Foster's PowerPaste from Homesite](http://www.sam-i-am.com/work/homesite/hs_powerpaste.html)

Usage
-----

1. Type a block of text using [*] as the placeholder
2. Select a block of text
3. Use the shortcut key (OS-X - Cmd+Ctrl+V, Windows/Linux = Ctrl+Alt+V)
4. Enter the text to PowerPaste
	* A coma delimited list of strings (ex. One,Two,Three)
	* A span of integers (ex. 5-10)
	* A single integer (ex. 5)
5. Congratulation, you have PowerPasted

Notes
-----

This is my first time writing python, I relied heavily on the tuts+ tutorial [How to Create a Sublime Text 2 Plugin](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/python-tutorials/how-to-create-a-sublime-text-2-plugin/), you may see many striking similarities.  I don't think I really needed to do this multi-threaded, but since it was so easy I did anyway.
